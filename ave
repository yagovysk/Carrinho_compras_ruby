Gone are ‚Äúworks on my machine‚Äù woes and lengthy setup\n      tasks, replaced instead by a simple, consistent, Docker-based\n      development environment that will have your team up and running in\n      seconds.  Gain hands-on, real-world experience with a tool that‚Äôs\n      rapidly becoming fundamental to software development. Go from zero all\n      the way to production as Docker transforms the massive leap of\n      deploying your app in the cloud into a baby step.\n      </p>[0m[31m[1m"[0m,
